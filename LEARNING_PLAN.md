   - Spawning threads
   - Thread handles and join
   - Move closures with threads
2. **Channels** - `exercises/week5/channels`
   - mpsc (multiple producer, single consumer)
   - Thread communication patterns
   - Select-like operations
3. **Shared state** - `exercises/week5/shared_state`
   - Mutex for mutual exclusion
   - Arc for shared ownership
   - RwLock for reader-writer scenarios
4. **Atomics** - `exercises/week5/atomics`
   - Atomic types (AtomicBool, AtomicUsize, etc.)
   - Memory ordering (Relaxed, Acquire, Release, SeqCst)
   - Lock-free programming basics
5. **Concurrent data structures** - `exercises/week5/concurrent_structures`
   - Thread-safe queue
   - Concurrent counter
   - Producer-consumer pattern
6. **Testing concurrency** - `exercises/week5/testing_concurrency`
   - Testing for race conditions
   - Deterministic testing strategies
   - Using thread sanitizers
   - Stress testing concurrent code
   - Property-based testing for concurrency

### Phase 6: Practical Programming (Week 6)
**Goal**: Apply knowledge to real projects

#### Topics to Cover:
- Error handling patterns
- Testing (unit and integration)
- Documentation
- Common crates (serde, clap, tokio)
- Async programming basics
- Performance optimization

#### Projects:
1. **CLI Application** - `projects/cli-app` - Build a file organizer or todo list
2. **Web API** - `projects/web-api` - Create a simple REST service
3. **Concurrent application** - `projects/concurrent-app` - Build a multi-threaded web scraper or parallel data processor
4. **Systems programming** - Create a new project for file watcher or process monitor

## Resources

### Primary Resources:
- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/)

## Getting Started

1. Install Rust using rustup
2. Run `rustc --version` and `cargo --version` to verify installation
3. From the root directory, build all projects: `cargo build --workspace`
4. Start with week1 exercises:
   ```bash
   cd exercises/week1/hello_world
   cargo run
   ```
5. Follow along with The Rust Book
6. Commit your progress regularly!

## Running Exercises

Each exercise is a Cargo project. To work on an exercise:

```bash
# Navigate to the exercise
cd exercises/week1/hello_world

# Run the exercise
cargo run

# Check for compilation errors
cargo check

# Run tests (if any)
cargo test
```

You can also run from the root directory:

```bash
# Run a specific exercise from root
cargo run -p hello_world
cargo run -p ownership_basics
```

Happy learning! ðŸ¦€
